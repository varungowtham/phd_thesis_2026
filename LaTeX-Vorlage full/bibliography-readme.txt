Place the information about literature you used in the file "references-biblatex.bib" (located in the same directory as "main.tex").
You can use your LaTeX editor or any other editor to create and modify this file.

If using MiKTeX check that biber.exe is used to create the bibliography with biblatex.
The executable "biber.exe" is found in the MiKTeX bin directory, e.g.
"..\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\biber.exe" .

When using TeXnicCenter you can set the path of the BibTeX-Compiler by pressing "alt+F7" or
selecting "Ausgabe->Ausgabeprofile definieren...".
